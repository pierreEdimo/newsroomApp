    "With time, I realized that I was not informed enough in general." +
    "There are a lot of blogging applications in this world," +
    "and they deal with everyday problems, but very few that deal with" +
    "specific problems that one can encounter when living abroad, that's " +

    "As I said above, I was not informed enough when I arrived in Germany, which made me make many mistakes. " +
    "But I have learned from those. I learned to code, and I informed myself. " +
    "Today people are leaving their country and have the same problems I had to face," +
    "so I would like to help them as much as possible, " +
    "I would like to help those who have problems with programming" +
    " integration, in every way, if it can make their life better. Check out the application," +
    " I hope you who are reading this will find it useful. If you have any ideas for improvement, feel free to contact me.";
